## 🏢 Business Context

Palmoria Group is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria with operations in three regions. The company is currently under public and internal pressure after a viral news headline accused it of being a “manufacturing patriarchy,” due to gender inequality in its workforce.

To protect the company's expansion ambitions and public image, the CEO, Mr. Ayodeji Chukwuma, directed the Chief HR Officer, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe, to lead an urgent intervention. Mr. Shofoluwe recruited me as a data analyst to investigate gender equity, salary fairness, and regulatory compliance.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze gender distribution across the company.  
- Investigate performance ratings by gender.  
- Evaluate salary structure for potential gender pay gaps.  
- Verify compliance with a newly enforced $90,000 minimum wage policy.  
- Allocate performance-based bonuses and compute total employee compensation.  
- Visualize all key findings in interactive dashboards using Power BI.

## 🧾 Project Tasks

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Assign a generic gender value to employees with missing gender.  
- Remove records with missing salary (ex-employees).  
- Remove entries with `NULL` departments.  

### Core Analysis Questions

1. What is the gender distribution across the organization, departments, and regions?  
2. How do performance ratings vary by gender?  
3. Is there a gender-based pay gap? In which departments and regions is it most severe?  
4. Does Palmoria comply with the $90,000 minimum wage policy?  
5. What is the pay distribution of employees by salary bands ($10,000 intervals)?  
6. Based on performance ratings, how should bonuses be allocated?  
   - What is the total bonus and compensation per employee?  
   - What is the total payout per region and company-wide?
